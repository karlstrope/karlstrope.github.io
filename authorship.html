<h1>Authorship</h1>
<p>The only thing I can claim about these words is that they are <i>original</i> to me, and that I present them in good faith. I might make errors, or I could be missing something important. I cannot claim it is <i>complete</i>, or <i>infallable</i>, but I think it's worth thinking about.</p>
<p>If you see me on the streets, feel free to talk to me about these things or anything else on your mind. I like talking to people. I'm mostly doing my rendention of <i>neo arte povera</i>, which means a lot of black and sometimes there are holes in my clothes. My name is Karl. I don't bite; come say hi!</p>
